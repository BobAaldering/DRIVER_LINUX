# Drivers

#### Study on operating systems, creating a device driver.

This project contains a device driver developed for Linux (more specifically a Raspberry Pi). This driver has been rewritten as `AALDERING-DRIVER`. Subsequently, a number of additional functionalities were added to make the driver more complex.

It is possible to build the modules using `CMake`. For this, this 'README' also provides a further explanation of how this is possible, and how these created modules can be added to the kernel.
